## Overview

This repository contains basic workspace infrastructure for dsim repositories.

## Where is my README?

As part of [#182](https://github.com/ToyotaResearchInstitute/maliput_infrastructure/issues/182),
the README was migrated to [maliput_documentation](https://github.com/ToyotaResearchInstitute/maliput_documentation/blob/main/docs/installation_quickstart.rst).

## Where is my old and deprecated README?

There was a time, an ancient time where a different workflow was used.
In PR [#183](https://github.com/ToyotaResearchInstitute/maliput_infrastructure/pull/183) it got removed.
You could visit it, but please don't. You should not use it anymore.
